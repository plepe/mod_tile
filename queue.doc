In the renderd.conf the rendering-queues can be defined. The order of
these queues defines the priority (first come first server). A queue
entry always starts with "queue":

Example:
[queue high_priority]
maxRender=3
minz=16
age=3

[queue low_priority]
maxRender=1
age=14

This defines two rendering queues. The first takes requests for
metatiles from zoom-level 16 on, where the old tiles are at least 3 days
old. The second takes requests for metatiles for each zoomlevel but only
when tiles are at least 14 days old. No matter how many render-threads
are defined, the first queue never uses more than 3 at a time, the
second even no more than 1 at a time. So the renderd doesn't get stuck
with long-lastings requests for low zoom levels.

The following variables can be set for the queues:
maxRender=n	Never use more than n render threads at a time (default:
		NUM_THREADS from render_config.h)
minz=n		The queue takes requests for tiles z>=n (default: 0)
maxz=n          The queue takes requests for tiles z<=n (default:
		MAX_ZOOM from render_config.h)
age=f		Only render metatiles aged >=f days (default: 3.0)
                If age=0 only new tiles can be added to this queue
dirty=n		Depends on the type of the request. Possible vales:
                -1 ... don't care (default)
		1 .... render only tiles which are 'dirty'
		0 .... render only new tiles
